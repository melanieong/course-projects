              I've had a love for drawing since I was 11, and it's opened my
              eyes to a lot around me. I love drawing people, but I'd love to
              learn more about drawing environment and capturing moods. I
              believe that art is a lifelong journey, and I'll be forever
              enamoured in it. I am currently figuring out how to start making
              commissions for others, both to improve my art, and to give back
              to my supporters.

              All throughout my childhood, I've been a hobbyist in music. I
              played the piano since I was three and dabbled in learning the
              guitar, violin, and alto saxophone. My family loves karaoke, so
              I've grown up singing and even performed in musical theatre plays
              for a couple years!
